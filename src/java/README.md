Simple Game Framework - Java Engine
===================================

The Java engine is a J2SE compliant implementation of the `Simple Game
Framework`. Currently the game engine can be loaded through a JFrame, and SGF
games can be played on the desktop. In the future, a JApplet version is
planned, for web deployment (if for some reason the HTML client isn't good
enough).

Build
-----

Building the source requires Apache Ant. All you need to do is type:

    ant

in the `java` directory to build an executable JFrame Jar file named `SGF.jar`.
