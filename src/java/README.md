Simple Game Framework - Java Engine
===================================

The Java engine is a J2SE compliant implementation of the `Simple
Game Framework`. Currently the game engine can be loaded through
a JFrame, and SGF games can be played on the desktop. In the future,
a JApplet version should become available, for web deployment (if
for some reason the HTML client isn't good enough).
