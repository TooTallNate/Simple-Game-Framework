"Simple Game Framework", or SGF for short, is a framework that exposes
a JavaScript based API to develop simple, tile and sprite based games.

The idea is that the game developer writes games using one code base,
written in JavaScript, and incorporating the SGF API. This JS code base
can then be deployed to any number of game engine clients. Some ideas of
game engine clients would:

    - HTML/DOM: An engine that uses web browsers' native JavaScript engine
                to execute the game code, and the API manipulates DOM nodes
                and/or uses Canvas to render your game. I (TooTallNate) am
                developing this client engine first, and as the SGF API
                itself is being developed.

    - Flash: A Flash engine could be written that (theoretically) uses
             ExternalInterface to communicate your game code with the
             Flash based rendering engine. This is only an idea though,
             and the lag between JavaScript and ExternalInterface might
             make this impossible. Either way, I (TooTallNate), know
             nothing about Flash development, and will never be making
             a Flash version of the game engine. Somebody else is welcome
             to jump in though!

    - Java: In conjunction with Rhino (http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/), we
            can use Java to interprit your game code, and use Java2D or
            JOGL to render the game. I (TooTallNate) might end up writing
            the Java version at some point, but the HTML/DOM version is
            a higher priority, and development on this won't begin until
            the HTML/DOM version is complete (unless somebody else wants
            to write it!).

    - Any other language that has a JavaScript Interpreter/Engine:
          In theory, this game engine is reusable anywhere that JavaScript
          can be implemented! That's the beauty of developing your game
          in an interpreted language.
